# EngineFromScratch
## brief
A repo of basic game engine, currently I got:
1. memoryManager,
2. asset manager,
3. scene manager(more type of scene file need to support),
4. OpenGL RHI( Vulkan RHI design in progress, se my another repo in here [MyVulkanRHI](https://github.com/moonflo/MyVulkanRHI),
5. TODO...

## Install
1. Clone this repo (Make sure it's a clone but NOT download as ZIP file, for we have some submodules in this);
2. Run build_all.bat for the initial install of all external dependencies;
3. visual studio sln is in ./build, for any code modification one should only run the rebuild.bat for it;
